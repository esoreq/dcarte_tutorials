    "# Introduction to Linux Based Command Line Interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why would I use a Terminal \n",
    "In the old days, independent devices, or so-called \"hard copy terminals\" (printer or screen plus keyboard), were used. Modern computers no longer have those, replaced by terminal emulators - programs that provide users with a graphical window for interacting with the shell. As scientists, we rely on powerful computer clusters to reveal answers to many questions and to perform many tasks automatically. There are many ways to interact with these computers. However, the fastest and most reliable way is the terminal emulators, which is the main focus of today's session.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic terminology \n",
    "\n",
    "### graphical user interface (GUI)\n",
    "In its most basic form, all computers have some interaction to store, process, create data, take actions, and communicate with other computers and people. There are many ways to interact with the computer. However, the most common is the GUI, which uses a mix of windows, icons, mice, and pointers to perform various tasks. This user interface type makes it easier for users to navigate through and use hundreds of programs, often from within a complex hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Command-line interface (CLI)\n",
    "Under the hood, all computers have a command-line interface, or CLI, which distinguishes it from the more common GUI, which most people use nowadays. A CLI's heart is a read-evaluate-print loop or REPL: when a user types a command and presses enter, the computer reads the command, runs the command, and prints out the output until the user breaks the cycle. One of the programs in charge of enabling this cycle is called a shell or terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Shell/Terminal\n",
    "The shell is a program that serves as a keyboard-driven interface between the user and the operating system. It includes a command-line interpreter that accepts the user input via the keyboard, evaluates it, starts programs if necessary, and returns the output in the form of text output to the user. Each shell has its programming language, which makes it possible to write scripts that automate complex tasks. Each shell runs in a terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Bash\n",
    "One of the differences between a shell and any other program is that a shell runs other programs instead of doing calculations. One of the most popular Unix shells is Bash, named for the Bourne Again Shell (derived from a shell originally written by Stephen Bourne). In most modern Unix implementations and most packages designed for Windows, Bash is the default shell.\n",

    "1. on Windows - I dont use windows so if anyone can tell me the shortcut that would be great \n",
    "```\n",
    "### Command prompt\n",
